## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Album Matching Accuracy: 77%**
   - Some tracks return compilations instead of primary albums
   - This is due to MusicBrainz having multiple releases per track
   - Offline DB uses popularity scoring, which can favor compilations
   - **Impact**: Low - users rarely care about specific album names
   - **Workaround**: Use iTunes API fallback for better album accuracy

2. **iTunes API Rate Limiting**
   - Apple limits to ~20 requests/minute
   - Users may need to wait and retry for large files
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects users with 1000+ missing tracks
   - **Workaround**: Retry button after 60+ seconds

3. **MusicBrainz Database Size: 2GB**
   - Large download and optimization time (10-30 minutes)
   - Takes disk space
   - **Impact**: Low - one-time setup
   - **Benefit**: Ultra-fast searches (1-5ms vs 500ms for API)

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Search Speed
- **Offline DB**: 1-5ms per track (10,000+ tracks/sec)
- **iTunes API**: 500-1000ms per track (~2 tracks/sec)
- **MusicBrainz API**: 300-500ms per track (~3 tracks/sec)

### Success Rates (from 3-way comparison test)
- **Offline DB**: 100% track finding success
- **MusicBrainz API**: 100% track finding success
- **iTunes API**: 64% track finding success

### Album Accuracy
- **Offline DB**: 77% exact match with MusicBrainz API
- **Remaining 23%**: Valid alternative albums (compilations, regional variants, remasters)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Launch
```bash
# Check Python version (needs 3.12+)
python --version

# Check dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try verbose mode
python -v run_toga_app.py
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database location
ls -lh ~/Library/Application\ Support/AppleMusicConverter/musicbrainz/

# Delete and re-optimize
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/AppleMusicConverter/musicbrainz/
# Then use UI to download and optimize
```

### CSV Not Processing
- Check file encoding (should be UTF-8)
- Verify CSV has required columns (Artist, Track, or Song Name)
- Try smaller file first to isolate issue
