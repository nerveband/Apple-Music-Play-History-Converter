# Release Workflow

Complete step-by-step guide for building and releasing a new version.

## Build Strategy (v2.0.0+)

- **macOS**: Build locally (fast, secure, you have Mac)
- **Windows**: GitHub Actions (automated, no Windows machine needed)
- **Linux**: Source code only (users compile from source)

## Prerequisites

- **macOS Machine**: Your primary Mac
- **GitHub Account**: For automated Windows builds
- **Apple Developer ID**: For macOS code signing & notarization
- **Git & Python 3.12+**: Installed locally

---

## Step 1: Prepare for Release

### Update Version Numbers

```bash
# 1. Update version in THREE places:
#    - pyproject.toml: [project] version = "2.0.0"
#    - pyproject.toml: [tool.briefcase] version = "2.0.0"
#    - src/apple_music_history_converter/__init__.py: __version__ = "2.0.0"

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new features/fixes

# 3. Commit version bump
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 2.0.0"
git push origin main

# 4. Create and push version tag
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0
```

---

## Step 2: Build macOS (Local)

### Why Local?
- ✅ Fast (2 minutes vs 10+ on CI/CD)
- ✅ Secure (signing cert stays on your Mac)
- ✅ You have a Mac anyway

### Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/path/to/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf build/ dist/

# Build and package with signing & notarization
briefcase package macOS --identity "Developer ID Application: Ashraf Ali (7HQVB2S4BX)"

# Output: dist/Apple Music History Converter-2.0.0.dmg
# This DMG is fully signed, notarized, and stapled - ready for distribution

# Verify notarization
spctl -a -t exec -vv "dist/Apple Music History Converter-2.0.0.dmg"
# Should show: "accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID"

# Optional: Copy to Desktop for safekeeping
cp "dist/Apple Music History Converter-2.0.0.dmg" ~/Desktop/
```

---

## Step 3: Build Windows (GitHub Actions)

### Why GitHub Actions?
- ✅ Automated (no Windows VM needed)
- ✅ Free for public repos
- ✅ Consistent build environment

### Trigger Build

The build triggers automatically when you push to `main` or `feature/ui-rewrite` branches.

**Or manually trigger:**

1. Go to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter/actions
2. Click "Build Windows App" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select branch → "Run workflow"

### Monitor Build

```bash
# Watch build progress from terminal
gh run list --workflow=build-windows.yml --limit 1

# Or watch live
gh run watch <run-id>
```

### Download Build

```bash
# Download latest Windows build artifact
gh run list --workflow=build-windows.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId,status
gh run download <run-id> --dir ~/Desktop/windows-build

# The ZIP will be in: ~/Desktop/windows-build/apple-music-history-converter-windows-x86_64/
```

**Output**: Portable Windows ZIP (no installer - just extract and run .exe)

**Format**: x86_64 architecture (compatible with ARM Windows via emulation)

---

## Step 4: Linux (No Builds)

### Why No Linux Builds?
- ✅ Linux users are tech-savvy enough to compile from source
- ✅ Reduces maintenance overhead
- ✅ Multiple distro formats would be complex (deb, rpm, AppImage, Flatpak)
- ✅ Briefcase AppImage support is discouraged by BeeWare team

### Linux Installation Instructions (for README)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter.git
cd Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
python run_toga_app.py
```

---

## Step 5: Create GitHub Release

### Upload Both Builds

```bash
# Navigate to folder with both builds
cd ~/Desktop/

# Create GitHub release with both artifacts
gh release create v2.0.0 \
  --title "v2.0.0 - Feature Release Title" \
  --notes "## What's New

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Bug fix 1

## Downloads

### macOS (Recommended)
- **Apple Music History Converter-2.0.0.dmg** (Signed & Notarized)
- Extract and drag to Applications folder
- No security warnings (fully notarized)

### Windows
- **Apple_Music_History_Converter_Windows_2.0.0.zip** (Portable)
- Extract ZIP and run \`Apple Music History Converter.exe\`
- No installation needed
- Windows Defender may show SmartScreen warning (click 'More info' → 'Run anyway')

### Linux
- **Source code only** - see installation instructions in README
- Linux users: Clone repo and run from source

## Installation

### macOS
1. Download DMG
2. Open DMG
3. Drag app to Applications folder
4. Launch from Applications

### Windows
1. Download ZIP
2. Extract to any folder
3. Run \`Apple Music History Converter.exe\`
4. If SmartScreen appears: Click 'More info' → 'Run anyway'

### Linux
See README for source installation instructions.
" \
  "Apple Music History Converter-2.0.0.dmg" \
  "Apple_Music_History_Converter_Windows_2.0.0.zip"
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Release

```bash
# Open release page
open https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter/releases/latest

# Verify:
# ✅ macOS DMG uploaded
# ✅ Windows ZIP uploaded
# ✅ Release notes are correct
# ✅ Download links work
# ✅ Version tag matches
```

## Build Architecture Summary

| Platform | Build Method | Format | Architecture | Distribution |
|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **macOS** | Local (Briefcase) | DMG | Universal (x86_64 + ARM64) | Signed & Notarized |
| **Windows** | GitHub Actions | Portable ZIP | x86_64 | Unsigned |
| **Linux** | N/A | Source Code | Any | Users compile |

## Troubleshooting

### macOS Build Issues

**Signature fails**:
```bash
# Verify certificate installed
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
# Should show: Developer ID Application: Ashraf Ali (7HQVB2S4BX)
```

**Notarization fails**:
```bash
# Check credentials stored
xcrun notarytool history --apple-id nerveband@gmail.com

# Re-store credentials if needed
source .env
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "briefcase-macOS-$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
  --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD"
```

### Windows Build Issues

**Build fails on GitHub Actions**:
- Check workflow logs: https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter/actions
- Common issues:
  - Version number mismatch (check all 3 locations)
  - Dependency installation failures
  - Briefcase compatibility issues

**Wrong version in ZIP filename**:
- The ZIP folder name comes from Briefcase metadata
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` has correct version in both places
- Workflow includes clean step to prevent caching

### GitHub Release Issues

**gh CLI not authenticated**:
```bash
gh auth login
```

**Upload fails**:
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure files exist in current directory
- Verify you have write access to repo
