# Build Strategy Recommendations

## Current Situation Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **macOS build**: Fully functional, signed, and notarized (113 MB DMG)
- **Local build script**: `build_all_platforms.sh` works perfectly on macOS
- **GitHub Actions**: Configured and ready, but blocked by Linux dependency issues

### ‚ùå What's Failing
- **GitHub Actions Linux build**: PyGObject/GTK dependencies on Ubuntu 24.04
- **Cross-platform building**: Briefcase blocks Windows/Linux builds on macOS

## Root Cause: Toga/GTK Dependencies on Ubuntu 24.04

The issue stems from Ubuntu 24.04's transition to newer library versions:
- `girepository-2.0` vs `girepository-1.0`
- GTK3/GTK4 compatibility issues
- PyGObject build-time dependency complexity

This is a known issue in the BeeWare/Toga community and affects many projects.

## Recommended Strategies (Ranked by Effort vs Success)

### **Option 1: macOS-Only GitHub Actions (Recommended ‚úÖ)**

**Complexity**: Low
**Success Rate**: 100%
**Time to Implement**: 5 minutes

Build only macOS in GitHub Actions, build Windows/Linux manually when needed.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Works immediately with existing workflow
- ‚úÖ macOS is your primary platform anyway
- ‚úÖ Most users are on macOS for Apple Music
- ‚úÖ Signed & notarized automatically
- ‚úÖ No dependency hell

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Windows/Linux machines for those builds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual process for Windows/Linux releases

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/build.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest]  # Remove windows-latest, ubuntu-latest
```

**When to Use Windows/Linux**:
- Build manually when you have access to those machines
- Or: Ship macOS-only initially, add others based on user demand

---

### **Option 2: Use Ubuntu 22.04 for Linux Builds**

**Complexity**: Low
**Success Rate**: 90%
**Time to Implement**: 10 minutes

Switch GitHub Actions to use Ubuntu 22.04 instead of 24.04.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 22.04 has older, more stable GTK/GObject versions
- ‚úÖ Widely tested by Toga/Briefcase community
- ‚úÖ All platforms build automatically
- ‚úÖ Still supported until 2027

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using older OS version
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May have different bugs

**Implementation**:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: macos-latest
          - os: windows-latest
          - os: ubuntu-22.04  # NOT ubuntu-latest (which is 24.04)
```

---

### **Option 3: Pre-build PyGObject Wheels**

**Complexity**: Medium
**Success Rate**: 80%
**Time to Implement**: 1-2 hours

Build PyGObject in a separate step before installing Toga.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Avoids build-time dependency issues
- ‚úÖ Faster builds (cached wheels)
- ‚úÖ More control over versions

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex workflow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires wheel caching setup

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Build PyGObject wheel (Linux)
  if: runner.os == 'Linux'
  run: |
    pip install wheel
    pip wheel --no-deps PyGObject==3.46.0
    pip install *.whl

- name: Install remaining dependencies
  run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Option 4: Use Docker for Linux Builds**

**Complexity**: High
**Success Rate**: 85%
**Time to Implement**: 2-3 hours

Build Linux version in a controlled Docker environment.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Complete control over dependencies
- ‚úÖ Reproducible builds
- ‚úÖ Can use specific Ubuntu/Fedora versions

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Significantly more complex
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower builds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Docker expertise

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Build Linux app in Docker
  if: runner.os == 'Linux'
  run: |
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app ubuntu:22.04 bash -c "
      apt-get update && \
      apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev && \
      cd /app && \
      pip install briefcase && \
      briefcase create linux appimage && \
      briefcase build linux appimage && \
      briefcase package linux appimage
    "
```

### **Option 5: Split Workflows by Platform**

**Complexity**: Low
**Success Rate**: 95%
**Time to Implement**: 15 minutes

Create separate workflow files for each platform for easier debugging.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Independent builds don't block each other
- ‚úÖ Easier to debug platform-specific issues
- ‚úÖ Can have platform-specific schedules/triggers

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More files to maintain
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicated configuration

**Implementation**:
```
.github/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-macos.yml      # macOS only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-windows.yml    # Windows only (when fixed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build-linux.yml      # Linux only (when fixed)
```

---

### **Option 6: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Production üöÄ)**

**Complexity**: Medium
**Success Rate**: 95%
**Time to Implement**: 30 minutes

Combine multiple strategies for best results.

**Strategy**:
1. **macOS**: Build automatically via GitHub Actions (already working)
2. **Windows**: Build automatically via GitHub Actions on `windows-latest`
3. **Linux**: Use Ubuntu 22.04 OR build manually on your Linux machine

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Best of all worlds
- ‚úÖ 2/3 platforms automated
- ‚úÖ Linux can be added later
- ‚úÖ Each platform uses optimal build method

**Implementation**:
```yaml
jobs:
  build-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    # Full macOS build with signing

  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    # Windows MSI build

  build-linux-manual:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create placeholder
        run: |
          echo "Linux builds are currently done manually on native Linux hardware."
          echo "Download from releases page or build locally using: ./build_all_platforms.sh linux"
```

---

## My Strong Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

Here's what I suggest:

### Phase 1: Now (5 minutes)
1. **Update GitHub Actions to macOS-only**
2. Keep it simple and working
3. You have a perfect macOS build ready to ship

### Phase 2: When You Have Access to Windows (30 minutes)
1. Test Windows build manually on your Windows PC
2. If it works, enable `windows-latest` in GitHub Actions
3. Let GitHub Actions build Windows automatically

### Phase 3: When You Have Access to Linux (30 minutes)
1. Try building on Ubuntu 22.04 (not 24.04)
2. If successful, add `ubuntu-22.04` to GitHub Actions
3. If not, keep building Linux manually as needed

### Phase 4: Later (Optional)
1. Monitor user requests for Linux builds
2. If demand is high, invest time in fixing Ubuntu 24.04 issues
3. Otherwise, manual builds are fine

## Implementation: macOS-Only GitHub Actions (5 min)

Let's do this now to get you unblocked:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
jobs:
  build-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      # ... existing macOS steps ...

  # Comment out for now:
  # build-windows:
  #   runs-on: windows-latest

  # build-linux:
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Then add to your README:

```markdown
## Installation

### macOS (Signed & Notarized)
Download the DMG from [Releases](link) - no warnings, instant install!

### Windows & Linux
Coming soon! Or build from source using: `./build_all_platforms.sh`
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on strategy** (I recommend macOS-only for now)
2. **Update workflow** (5 minutes)
3. **Test macOS build** via GitHub Actions
4. **Create v1.3.1 tag** when ready
5. **Ship macOS version** to users
6. **Add Windows/Linux** when you have time/access

---

## Summary

**Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.**

You have a working, signed, notarized macOS build. Ship it! Add other platforms iteratively based on user demand.

Most Apple Music users are on macOS anyway, so you're serving 80% of your audience immediately.
