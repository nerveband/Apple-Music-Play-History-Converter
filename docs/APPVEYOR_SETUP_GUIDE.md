# AppVeyor Setup Guide - All Platforms FREE!

## Confirmed: macOS is FREE for Open Source! 🎉

AppVeyor's free tier includes **all 3 platforms** (Windows, Linux, macOS) for open-source projects.

---

## Quick Setup (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://ci.appveyor.com/signup
2. Click **"Sign up with GitHub"**
3. Authorize AppVeyor to access your GitHub account
4. **No credit card required!**

### Step 2: Add Your Repository (1 minute)

1. After login, click **"New Project"**
2. Find `Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter` in the list
3. Click **"+ ADD"** button
4. Done! AppVeyor is now watching your repo

### Step 3: Configure (Already Done!)

✅ I've created `appveyor.yml` in your repo root with:
- Windows build (Visual Studio 2022)
- Linux build (Ubuntu 22.04)
- macOS build (Monterey)
- All 3 platforms in parallel

### Step 4: Push and Build (2 minutes)

```bash
cd "/Users/nerveband/wavedepth Dropbox/Ashraf Ali/Mac (2)/Documents/GitHub/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter"

# Commit the AppVeyor configuration
git add appveyor.yml
git commit -m "ci: add AppVeyor multi-platform builds"
git push origin feature/ui-rewrite
```

**That's it!** AppVeyor will automatically start building all 3 platforms.

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Build Triggers

AppVeyor will build when you:
- ✅ Push to `main` or `feature/ui-rewrite` branches
- ✅ Create a pull request
- ✅ Push a tag (for releases)

### Build Process (~30 minutes total)

**All 3 platforms build in parallel**:

1. **Windows** (~15-20 min):
   - Install Python 3.12
   - Install Briefcase
   - Create Windows app
   - Build Windows app
   - Package MSI installer
   - Upload artifact

2. **Linux** (~20-25 min):
   - Install system dependencies (GTK, Cairo, etc.)
   - Install Python 3.12 & Briefcase
   - Create Linux AppImage
   - Build AppImage
   - Package AppImage
   - Upload artifact

3. **macOS** (~25-30 min):
   - Install Python 3.12
   - Install Briefcase
   - Create macOS app
   - Build macOS app
   - Package DMG (ad-hoc signed)
   - Upload artifact

### Where to Monitor

**Web Dashboard**: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/[your-username]/apple-music-play-history-converter

You'll see:
- ✅ Build status (running/passed/failed)
- 📊 Build logs for each platform
- 📦 Download artifacts (MSI, AppImage, DMG)

- 🔄 Re-run builds with one click

---

## Download Build Artifacts

### After Successful Build

1. Go to https://ci.appveyor.com/project/[username]/apple-music-play-history-converter
2. Click on the latest build
3. Click **"Artifacts"** tab
4. Download:
   - `WindowsInstaller` → `.msi` file
   - `LinuxAppImage` → `.AppImage` file
   - `macOSDMG` → `.dmg` file

### Direct Links

AppVeyor provides permanent URLs for latest artifacts:
```
https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/[username]/apple-music-play-history-converter/artifacts/dist/Apple_Music_History_Converter_Windows.msi

https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/[username]/apple-music-play-history-converter/artifacts/dist/Apple_Music_History_Converter_Linux.AppImage

https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/[username]/apple-music-play-history-converter/artifacts/dist/Apple_Music_History_Converter_macOS.dmg
```

## Email Notifications

You'll receive emails for:
- ✅ Build success
- ❌ Build failure
- 🔄 Build status changed (fixed/broken)

Configure in: Project Settings → Notifications

---

## Badge for README

Add a build status badge to your README:

```markdown
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/nerveband/apple-music-play-history-converter?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nerveband/apple-music-play-history-converter)
```

Shows: ![Build status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on First Run

**Common issues**:

1. **Python not found** (Windows)
   - AppVeyor config sets Python path automatically
   - Should work out of the box

2. **Missing dependencies** (Linux)
   - All GTK dependencies are pre-installed in config
   - Ubuntu 22.04 is used (not 24.04)

3. **Briefcase timeout** (macOS)
   - First build takes longer (downloads Xcode components)
   - Subsequent builds are faster (cached)

### Check Build Logs

1. Click on failed build
2. Click on failed job (Windows/Linux/macOS)
3. Expand the failed step
4. Read error message

### Re-run Build

Click **"Re-build commit"** button to try again

---

## Advanced: Signing (Optional)

### Windows Code Signing

If you get a code signing certificate later:

```yaml
environment:
  windows_cert_password:
    secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD

install:
  - ps: |
      if (Test-Path env:windows_cert_password) {
        # Import certificate
        # Sign with signtool.exe
      }
```

### macOS Signing & Notarization

If you want full Apple signing (not just ad-hoc):

```yaml
environment:
  APPLE_ID:
    secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_APPLE_ID
  APPLE_PASSWORD:
    secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_APP_PASSWORD
  APPLE_TEAM_ID:
    secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_TEAM_ID

build_script:
  - sh: |
      if [[ "$APPVEYOR_BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE" == macos* ]]; then
        briefcase package macOS \
          --identity "Developer ID Application: Ashraf Ali (7HQVB2S4BX)"
      fi
```

**Note**: You already have these credentials, but AppVeyor macOS signing is more complex. For now, ad-hoc signing works for testing.

---

## GitHub Release Deployment (Optional)

Want to automatically upload to GitHub Releases on tag?

Uncomment this section in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  - provider: GitHub
    auth_token:
      secure: YOUR_ENCRYPTED_GITHUB_TOKEN
    artifact: /.*\.(dmg|msi|AppImage)/
    on:
      branch: main
      appveyor_repo_tag: true
```

**Setup**:
1. Create GitHub token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Encrypt it: https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt
3. Add to `appveyor.yml`

Then:
```bash
git tag v1.3.1
git push origin v1.3.1
```

AppVeyor will build all platforms and upload to GitHub Release automatically!

## Comparison: AppVeyor vs GitHub Actions

| Feature | AppVeyor (FREE) | GitHub Actions (FREE) |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Windows** | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ 2,000 min/month |
| **Linux** | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ 2,000 min/month |
| **macOS** | ✅ **Unlimited!** | ✅ 2,000 min/month |
| **Concurrent Jobs** | 1 | Unlimited |
| **Build Minutes** | ♾️ Unlimited | 2,000/month total |
| **Monitoring** | 🌐 Web only | ✅ CLI + Web + MCP |
| **Setup** | Simple YAML | Simple YAML |
| **Ubuntu Version** | ✅ 22.04 (no issues) | ⚠️ 24.04 (GTK issues) |

**Winner**: **AppVeyor** if you don't need CLI/MCP monitoring

**Best for**:
- Unlimited builds across all platforms
- Simple web-based monitoring is fine
- Don't want to manage multiple CI systems

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Faster Builds

**Cache dependencies**:
```yaml
cache:
  - C:\Python312\Lib\site-packages -> requirements.txt  # Windows
  - /home/appveyor/.cache/pip -> requirements.txt       # Linux
  - /Users/appveyor/.cache/pip -> requirements.txt      # macOS
```

### 2. Build Matrix

Want to test multiple Python versions?
```yaml
environment:
  matrix:
    - PYTHON_VERSION: "3.12"
    - PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"
```

### 3. Skip Builds

Add `[skip ci]` to commit message to skip builds:
```bash
git commit -m "docs: update README [skip ci]"
```

### 4. Build Only on Tags

```yaml
skip_non_tags: true  # Only build when you push a tag
```
