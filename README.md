```

## Usage

### Basic Conversion
1. Launch the application
2. Click "Choose File" to select your Apple Music CSV file
3. Select the appropriate file type (Play Activity, Recently Played Tracks, or Play History Daily Tracks)
4. Choose your preferred search provider (MusicBrainz or iTunes API)
5. Click "Convert" and wait for the process to complete

### MusicBrainz Setup (Recommended)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The MusicBrainz database is approximately **2GB** in size when compressed, but requires **8GB RAM** (6GB minimum) to operate efficiently.

#### How MusicBrainz Preloading Works

The application uses an intelligent preloading system for optimal performance:

1. **Download Phase**: Compressed MusicBrainz data (~2GB) is downloaded from official mirrors
2. **Extraction Phase**: Data is decompressed using high-speed zstandard compression
3. **DuckDB Conversion**: CSV data is imported into DuckDB format for ultra-fast querying
4. **Indexing**: Artist and recording indexes are built for sub-millisecond search times
5. **Startup Preloading**: Database connections are cached and kept warm for instant access

#### Setup Options

You have three options when setting up MusicBrainz:

1. **Automatic Download**:
   - Select "MusicBrainz" as your search provider in Settings
   - Click "Download Database" to get the offline music database
   - Wait for download and extraction to complete
   - Enable "Auto-fallback to iTunes" for comprehensive coverage

2. **Manual Import**:
   - Download the database file manually from: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainzDatabase
   - Look for `musicbrainz-artist-recordings.tar.zst`
   - Use the "Manual Import" option in the setup dialog OR click the "Manual Import" button in the main interface
   - Select the downloaded file to import

3. **Use iTunes API Instead**:
   - Skip MusicBrainz entirely
   - Select "iTunes API" as your search provider
   - No download required, but requires internet connection

### Manual Import Button Location

You can access the manual import functionality at any time through the main interface:
- Open the application
- Look for the "Music Database Settings" section in the main window
- Click the "Manual Import" button (located next to "Check for Updates", "Delete Database", and "Reveal Location" buttons)
- This opens the same manual import dialog with step-by-step instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Briefcase (installed automatically)
- For macOS builds: Apple Developer account and Xcode (for code signing)

### Build Commands

The project uses **BeeWare Briefcase** for modern, cross-platform native app building.

#### Complete Build Pipeline
```bash
briefcase create   # Create the app structure
briefcase build    # Build the application
briefcase package  # Create distributable package
```

#### Development and Testing
```bash
briefcase dev      # Run in development mode
briefcase run      # Run the built application
```

#### macOS-Specific Build with Notarization
```bash
# Set up Apple credentials (one-time)
source .env
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "briefcase-macOS-$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
    --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
    --team-id "$APPLE_TEAM_ID" \
    --password "$APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD"

# Build and notarize
briefcase package --identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
```

#### Platform-Specific Notes

**macOS**: 
- Builds universal binaries (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- Automatic code signing with Developer ID (if configured)
- Creates DMG installer for distribution
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for notarization setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical macOS tkinter Issue**: Briefcase doesn't include tkinter by default. After `briefcase build`, you must manually copy tkinter from your system Python or the app will crash with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`. 

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# After briefcase build, run this to fix tkinter:
SYSTEM_TKINTER=$(python -c "import tkinter; print(tkinter.__file__.replace('/__init__.py', ''))")  
cp -r "$SYSTEM_TKINTER" "build/apple-music-history-converter/macos/app/Apple Music History Converter.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/"

# Also copy the dynamic library:
SYSTEM_DYNLOAD=$(python -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('stdlib'))")/../lib-dynload
cp "$SYSTEM_DYNLOAD/_tkinter.cpython-312-darwin.so" "build/apple-music-history-converter/macos/app/Apple Music History Converter.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/lib-dynload/"
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete build instructions with automated scripts.

**Windows**:
