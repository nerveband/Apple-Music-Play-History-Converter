# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Get quick answers to common questions about Apple Music Play History Converter.

## General Questions

### What does this application do?

Apple Music Play History Converter transforms your Apple Music CSV export files into a Last.fm-compatible format. This allows you to:

- Import your complete Apple Music listening history into Last.fm
- Preserve your scrobble history when switching music services
- Analyze your music listening habits
- Process large CSV files (100,000+ tracks) efficiently

### Is my data sent to any servers?

No. All processing happens locally on your computer. Your music data never leaves your machine. The only network connections are:

- MusicBrainz database download (optional, one-time, ~2GB)
- iTunes API searches (if you choose iTunes as your search provider)

### What file formats are supported?

The application supports these Apple Music CSV export formats:

- **Play Activity**: Standard Apple Music export format
- **Recently Played Tracks**: Alternative export format
- **Play History Daily Tracks**: Daily aggregated format

The app automatically detects which format you have.

### How do I get my Apple Music CSV file?

1. Open Apple Music on your Mac
2. Go to **Account → View My Account**
3. Scroll to **Request a copy of your data**
4. Select **Play Activity** or **Play History**
5. Wait for Apple to email you the download link (usually 24-72 hours)
6. Download and extract the ZIP file

### What's the difference between MusicBrainz and iTunes API?

| Feature | MusicBrainz (Local DB) | iTunes API (Online) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | Ultra-fast (10,000+ tracks/sec) | Moderate (10 parallel workers) |
| **Setup** | Requires 2GB database download | Works immediately |
| **Internet** | Only needed for initial download | Required for every search |
| **Accuracy** | Very high (comprehensive music database) | Good (Apple's own data) |
| **Rate Limits** | None | 20 requests/minute |
| **Best For** | Large files (10k+ tracks) | Small files, quick checks |

**Recommendation**: Use MusicBrainz for large files. The one-time 2GB download is worth the 100x speed improvement.

## Installation Questions

### Do I need Python installed?

**No.** The pre-built apps for macOS and Windows include everything you need. Just download the installer and run it.

### Why does macOS say the app is "damaged"?

This usually means:

1. **You used `zip` to extract the app** - Use macOS's built-in Archive Utility or download a fresh copy from GitHub
2. **Corrupted download** - Re-download the DMG file
3. **Not properly signed** - Make sure you downloaded from the official GitHub releases page

**Fix**: Download the official DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter/releases/latest) and drag it to Applications.

### Can I run this on Linux?

Yes, but you need to compile from source. Linux pre-built binaries are not currently available. See [Building from Source](Building-from-Source) for instructions.

### How much disk space do I need?

- **App only**: 200MB
- **With MusicBrainz database**: 3GB total (2GB database + 1GB temporary files)
- **Recommended free space**: 5GB for comfortable operation

### How much RAM do I need?

- **Minimum**: 4GB (for iTunes API only)
- **Recommended**: 8GB or more (for MusicBrainz database)
- **Large files (100k+ tracks)**: 16GB recommended

## Usage Questions

### How long does processing take?

Processing time depends on your CSV file size and search provider:

| File Size | MusicBrainz (Local) | iTunes API (Online) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1,000 tracks | < 1 minute | 2-5 minutes |
| 10,000 tracks | 1-2 minutes | 20-30 minutes |
| 100,000 tracks | 10-15 minutes | 3-5 hours |

**MusicBrainz is 100x faster** for large files.

### Can I pause and resume processing?

**Yes!** The app includes auto-save checkpoints every 50 tracks. If you need to stop:

1. Close the app (your progress is automatically saved)
2. Re-open and load the same CSV file
3. Click "Resume Search" to continue where you left off

### What if some tracks aren't found?

This is normal. The app will:

1. Mark unfound tracks with a placeholder artist
2. Show you the count of missing tracks
3. Still export a valid CSV file for Last.fm

You can:

- Try the other search provider (switch between MusicBrainz and iTunes)
- Manually edit the output CSV to add missing information
- Export the list of failed tracks for review

### What does "rate limited" mean for iTunes API?

iTunes API limits requests to 20 per minute. When you hit this limit:

- The app automatically pauses and waits 60 seconds
- You'll see a "⏸️ Rate limited" message in the progress
- Processing resumes automatically after the cooldown

**Tip**: Use the "Retry Rate-Limited" button after waiting to retry tracks that hit the limit.

### Can I search multiple CSV files at once?

No, the app processes one CSV file at a time. For multiple files:

1. Process each file separately
2. Combine the output CSV files using a spreadsheet or text editor
3. Import the combined file to Last.fm

### Will this overwrite my existing Last.fm scrobbles?

No. Last.fm imports are additive - new scrobbles are added without affecting existing ones. However:

- Last.fm may reject duplicate scrobbles (same artist/track/timestamp)
- Recent scrobbles (within 14 days) are more likely to be accepted
- Very old scrobbles (years ago) may be rejected by Last.fm

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't start on macOS

**Cause**: Gatekeeper security or corrupted app bundle.

**Fix**:
1. Right-click the app and select "Open" (not double-click)
2. Click "Open" in the security dialog
3. If that fails, run: `xattr -cr "/Applications/Apple Music History Converter.app"`

### The app crashes on exit (macOS)

**Fixed in v2.0.2!** This was a known issue with the Toga framework. Update to the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nerveband/Apple-Music-Play-History-Converter/releases/latest).

### MusicBrainz database download fails

**Common causes**:
- Slow internet connection (2GB download takes time)
- Network timeout
- Not enough disk space (need 3GB free)

**Fix**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Free up disk space (need 3GB)
3. Try downloading during off-peak hours
4. Use iTunes API instead (no download required)

### iTunes API searches are very slow

This is normal. iTunes API is rate-limited to 20 requests per minute. For large files:

- Use MusicBrainz instead (100x faster)
- Let it run overnight for very large files
- Use the pause/resume feature to process in batches

### The output CSV is empty or incomplete

**Check**:
1. Did the search complete? Look for "Search complete" message
2. Did you click "Save" or "Export" after searching?
3. Check the file size - should be at least a few KB

**Fix**:
1. Re-run the search
2. Make sure to click "Save" after search completes
3. Try a different output location with write permissions

### App shows "Search already in progress" error

**Fixed in v2.0.1!** Update to the latest version. If you're on an old version:

1. Close the app completely
2. Re-open and try again
3. If it persists, restart your computer

## Performance Questions

### Why is the app using so much RAM?

For large CSV files (100k+ rows), the app loads the entire file into memory for fast processing. This is normal and expected. RAM usage scales with file size:

- 10k tracks: ~500MB RAM
- 100k tracks: ~2-3GB RAM
- 250k tracks: ~5-6GB RAM

**Tip**: Close other applications when processing very large files.

### Can I speed up processing?

**Yes!**

1. **Use MusicBrainz** instead of iTunes API (100x faster)
2. **More RAM** = faster pandas operations
3. **SSD storage** = faster database queries
4. **Don't run other heavy apps** during processing

### Does the app support Apple Silicon Macs?

**Yes!** The macOS app is a **universal binary** that runs natively on both:

- Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) - Fully optimized
- Intel Macs - Full compatibility

No Rosetta 2 translation needed.
