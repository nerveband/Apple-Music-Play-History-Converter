## Common Questions

**Q: How long does it take to convert my music history?**
A: With MusicBrainz: 1,000 tracks in <1 minute, 100,000 tracks in ~15 minutes. With iTunes API: much slower due to rate limits.

**Q: Do I need the MusicBrainz database?**
A: Not required, but highly recommended for files with 1,000+ tracks. It's 100x faster than iTunes API.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**
A: No. All processing happens locally on your computer. Your data never leaves your machine.

**Q: What formats are supported?**
A: Play Activity, Recently Played Tracks, and Play History Daily Tracks (auto-detected).
